abstract = {Vectorization provides a link between raster scans of pencil-and-paper drawings and modern digital processing algorithms that require accurate vector representations. Even when input drawings are comprised of clean, crisp lines, inherent ambiguities near junctions make vectorization deceptively difficult. As a consequence, current vectorization approaches often fail to faithfully capture the junctions of drawn strokes. We propose a vectorization algorithm specialized for clean line drawings that analyzes the drawing's topology in order to overcome junction ambiguities. A gradient-based pixel clustering technique facilitates topology computation. This topological information is exploited during centerline extraction by a new “reverse drawing” procedure that reconstructs all possible drawing states prior to the creation of a junction and then selects the most likely stroke configuration. For cases where the automatic result does not match the artist's interpretation, our drawing analysis enables an efficient user interface to easily adjust the junction location. We demonstrate results on professional examples and evaluate the vectorization quality with quantitative comparison to hand-traced centerlines as well as the results of leading commercial algorithms.},

We describe how we can train this model in a deterministic manner using standard backpropagation techniques and stochastically by maximizing a variational lower bound. We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence. We validate the use of attention with state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS COCO.}

As the field is moving rapidly, it has become unclear which elements of NMT architectures have a significant impact on translation quality. In this work, we present a large-scale analysis of the sensitivity of NMT architectures to common hyperparameters. We report empirical results and variance numbers for several hundred experimental runs, corresponding to over 250,000 GPU hours on a WMT English to German translation task. Our experiments provide practical insights into the relative importance of factors such as embedding size, network depth, RNN cell type, residual connections, attention mechanism, and decoding heuristics. As part of this contribution, we also release an open-source NMT framework in TensorFlow to make it easy for others to reproduce our results and perform their own experiments.",

abstract = {Abstract Nonlinear principal component analysis is a novel technique for multivariate data analysis, similar to the well-known method of principal component analysis. NLPCA, like PCA, is used to identify and remove correlations among problem variables as an aid to dimensionality reduction, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. While PCA identifies only linear correlations between variables, NLPCA uncovers both linear and nonlinear correlations, without restriction on the character of the nonlinearities present in the data. NLPCA operates by training a feedforward neural network to perform the identity mapping, where the network inputs are reproduced at the output layer. The network contains an internal “bottleneck” layer (containing fewer nodes than input or output layers), which forces the network to develop a compact representation of the input data, and two additional hidden layers. The NLPCA method is demonstrated using time-dependent, simulated batch reaction data. Results show that NLPCA successfully reduces dimensionality and produces a feature space map resembling the actual distribution of the underlying system parameters.},

abstract = {High-dimensional data can be converted to low-dimensional codes by training a multilayer neural network with a small central layer to reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such “autoencoder” networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.}}

  title =      "Reconstructing Production Data from Drawn Limited Animation",
  author =     "Felix Kugler",
  year =       "2023",
  abstract =   "The creation of traditional animation is performed in
               multiple steps, creating various intermediary products.
               Image processing and machine learning could be used for the
               automation of some of these time-consuming steps to help
               animators and studios. However, machine-learning solutions
               require large amounts of example data, which are not
               available for the intermediary products of animation. On the
               other hand, final animation is more easily available through
               public datasets, video releases, and streaming services.
               This work aims to bridge this gap by creating a tool to
               predict intermediary products of animation from frames of
               the final video, using machine learning. The predicted
               production data can then be used for further research. In
               particular, frames of traditional animation are made out of
               background and foreground elements, which are produced
               through different workflows. Foreground elements are created
               by first creating color-coded lineart. These are then
               colored and composited with the background. In this work,
               machine learning is used to undo these steps by separating a
               final frame into the foreground and background and
               recreating the lineart from the former.",

abstract = {Abstract Vectorization is a commonly used technique for converting raster images to vector format and has long been a research focus in computer graphics and vision. While a number of attempts have been made to extract the topology of line drawings and further convert them to vector representations, the existing methods commonly focused on resolving junctions composed of thin lines. They usually fail for line drawings composed of thick lines, especially at junctions. In this paper, we propose an automatic line drawing vectorization method that can reconstruct the topology of line drawings of arbitrary thickness. Our key observation is that no matter the lines are thin or thick, the boundaries of the lines always provide reliable hints for reconstructing the topology. For example, the boundaries of two continuous line segments at a junction are usually smoothly connected. By analyzing the continuity of boundaries, we can better analyze the topology at junctions. In particular, we first extract the skeleton of the input line drawing via thinning. Then we analyze the reliability of the skeleton points based on boundaries. Reliable skeleton points are preserved while unreliable skeleton points are reconstructed based on boundaries again. Finally, the skeleton after reconstruction is vectorized as the output. We apply our method on line drawings of various contents and styles. Satisfying results are obtained. Our method significantly outperforms existing methods for line drawings composed of thick lines.},

	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

        scikit-image is an image processing library that implements algorithms and utilities for use in research, education and industry applications. It is released under the liberal Modified BSD open source license, provides a well-documented API in the Python programming language, and is developed by an active, international team of collaborators. In this paper we highlight the advantages of open source to achieve the goals of the scikit-image library, and we showcase several real-world image processing applications that use scikit-image. More information can be found on the project homepage, http://scikit-image.org.

For 45° segments the error is approximately 2·10-6, and in general the approximation is sixth order accurate.}

abstract = {Humans and animals learn much better when the examples are not randomly presented but organized in a meaningful order which illustrates gradually more concepts, and gradually more complex ones. Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them "curriculum learning". In the context of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions).},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of improving the accuracy of an hypothesis output by a learning algorithm in the distribution-free (PAC) learning model. A concept class islearnable (orstrongly learnable) if, given access to a source of examples of the unknown concept, the learner with high probability is able to output an hypothesis that is correct on all but an arbitrarily small fraction of the instances. The concept class isweakly learnable if the learner can produce an hypothesis that performs only slightly better than random guessing. In this paper, it is shown that these two notions of learnability are equivalent.},
